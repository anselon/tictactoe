Some object oriented JavaScript that let's you play tic-tac-toe.

This simple implementation of tic tac toe uses only HTML, CSS and jQuery. It just keeps track of the current state (board) of the game with the interface rather than, say, localStorage or a JS Object. Therefore the model, view and controller are all mixed together in a not-so-great way. A Backbone version is coming soon to a repo near you (namely, this one).
